        "**Pareto Analysis** is a strategic decision-making tool used to prioritize actions based on the principle that a small number of causes typically lead to a large portion of the effects. Known as the 80/20 rule or the Pareto Principle, this concept is highly applicable in customer and product management, helping businesses focus on the most impactful areas to maximize efficiency and profitability.\n",

        "**i) Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule):**\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of customers and products, this principle suggests that roughly 80% of a company’s revenue comes from 20% of its customers or products. Understanding this can help businesses focus their efforts on the most valuable segments.\n",

        "**ii) Pareto Chart:**\n",
        "\n",
        "A Pareto chart is a graphical tool that helps visualize and prioritize the most significant factors among a set. It combines a bar graph and a line graph, where bars represent individual values in descending order, and the line shows the cumulative total.\n",

        "- The red point marked on the plot indicates the \"elbow point\" where the rate of decrease in WCSS slows down.\n",
        "- In this example, the elbow point is at K = 3. This suggests that 3 clusters are optimal for this dataset, as adding more clusters beyond this point results in only a marginal reduction in WCSS.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Interpretation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Before the Elbow Point: Adding more clusters significantly reduces WCSS, indicating that the clusters are becoming more defined and compact.\n",
        "- After the Elbow Point: The reduction in WCSS slows down, meaning that adding more clusters doesn’t significantly improve the clustering.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion**\n",
        "\n",
        "The Elbow Method helps to identify the optimal number of clusters by looking for the point where the WCSS starts to decrease at a slower rate, balancing model complexity and performance. In this case, the plot suggests that using 3 clusters is a good choice for the dataset."
